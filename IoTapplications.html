      <strong>Introduction: </strong>
      <br>
      My name is Akshit Singh and I am in enrolled in Bachelors of Software Engineering course in the global program offered by Chitkara University, Rajpura that is partnered with Deakin University, Australia. <br>
      I have completed the following units till today's date: 
          <ol type="i"></ol>
            <li>SIT102 Introduction to Programming</li>
            <li>SIT111 Algorithms and Computing Systems</li>
            <li>SIT192 Discrete Mathematics</li>
            <li>SEB101 Engineering Physics</li>
            <li>SIT217 Software Engineering 1: Robotics Project</li>
            <li>SIT123 Data Capture Technologies</li>
            <li>SIT232 Object Oriented Development</li>
            <li>SEJ101 Design Fundamentals</li>
            <li>SIT221 Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
            <li>SIT210 Embedded Systems</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong>Goals for this unit:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul type="circle"></ul>
        <li>To gain proper knowledge for developing, managing and integrating IoT applications with smart devices. </li>
        <li>To create working web applications models for cyber physical systems.</li>
        <li>To work in team using agile methodology</li>
      </p>

      <strong> Activity 1: </strong> 
      <br>
      The first activity helped us to gain deep insights about the meaning of IoT applications which simply communicate with IoT devices over the internet to operate, manage and share data without human assistance. This activity also inspired me to think about some internet-of-things applications such as smart wearables, smart building, Predictive analysis for smart farming, self-driving cars etc. Lastly, I gained knowledge about the key features that must be there to create IoT applications out of which Connectivity Management, Integration, Scope and Scalability features are most significant.

        <strong>Activity 2: </strong>
        <br>
        The second activity laid emphasis on the significance of the keyword, "smart" in smart buildings which simply demonstrates the optimal management of collected data through a series of AI and Machine Learning processes. It also threw some light on the scenarios of smart buildings out of which lighting management, temperature monitoring, hazard detection and structural health monitoring are one of the famous aspects. Furthermore, features like real-time interaction, data storage and collect, wireless communication are some of the significant pillars of smart buildings.

        <strong>Activity 3: </strong>
        <br>
        The third activity gave us the opportunity to explore various dimensions of the control interface, through which I got to learn that the high-level significant features of of the control interface of a smart buildings are Life safety, Building Management system, Application oriented services like gas leakage and, Safety and Security services like CCTV and Intrusion detection. In addition to this, the major users of such a control interface of a smart buidlings are automation assistants, Industies, technology users. Moreover, proper support and assistance is required from software and hardware end in the form of sensors, memory, actuators, microprocessor, operating systems, IoT cloud and much more.
